# x11-rs - X11 library bindings for Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daggerbot/x11-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daggerbot/x11-rs)

`x11`: [![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/x11)](https://crates.io/crates/x11)

`x11-dl`: [![](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/x11-dl)](https://crates.io/crates/x11-dl)

The X11 libraries written in C are available under the terms of the MIT license.
These bindings are available as public domain.

As of 2017 I don't have as much time to work on this myself as I once did (due to school and work,
both full time), but feel free to submit a pull request if anything you need is missing!
