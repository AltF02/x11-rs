[![Build Status](https://github.com/AltF02/x11-rs/workflows/Build/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/AltF02/x11-rs/actions)

`x11`: [![](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/x11.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/x11)

`x11-dl`: [![](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/x11-dl.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/x11-dl)

## FAQ:
* What is the difference between `x11` and `x11-dl`? x11 is statically linked, x11-dl is dynamically linked.
* What if I just want to basic calls to `xlib`? This crate provides calls to most x11 api's, if you want to do basic calls, take a look at https://github.com/notgull/tiny-xlib
