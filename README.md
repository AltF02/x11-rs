Hey everyone, have recently jumped on board here, still getting my head around things. I do apologise for any delays whilst I catch up to speed. Thanks for all the issues and PRs, keep them coming - Erle Pereira (updated: Sept 2019)

A new [wiki page](https://github.com/erlepereira/x11-rs/wiki) has been created with the intention of a detaling a roadmap and a focal point for a broader vision around this codebase.

As of 2017 I don't have as much time to work on this myself as I once did (due to school and work,
both full time), but feel free to submit a pull request if anything you need is missing!
