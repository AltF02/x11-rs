Hey all, have recently jumped on board here. Hoping to continue the good work already done and contribute more. 
Still getting my head around to things. 

I do apologise for the slight delays there might be whilst I catch up to speed..
Thanks for all the issues and PRs, keep them coming - Erle Pereira (updated: Aug 2018)

The X11 libraries written in C are available under the terms of the MIT license.
These bindings are available as public domain.

As of 2017 I don't have as much time to work on this myself as I once did (due to school and work,
both full time), but feel free to submit a pull request if anything you need is missing!
